Prompt File: Production Deployment Coding Instructions
Guidelines:

Do NOT create new files without explicit approval.
If a new file is necessary, ask for permission and wait for a reply before proceeding.

Only modify existing files.
Always check if the file exists before making changes. If it does not exist, do nothing.

Keep code changes simple, short, and production-friendly.
Avoid adding unnecessary complexity, features, or dependencies.

Do NOT add extra try-catch or exception handling blocks.
Rely on existing error handling unless specifically instructed otherwise.

Do NOT split code into multiple files or create large files.
Keep all changes within a single, relevant file.

Prioritize clarity and maintainability.
Write code that is easy to understand and maintain in a production environment.

Check that the terminal is open and ready for input before executing any commands.Also check if its powershell or bash before executing any commands.
If the terminal is not open, do not execute any commands.Check the .venv is activated before executing any commands.
If the .venv is not activated, do not execute any commands.

Reuse the existing terminal if its already open and ready for input.
